### What I Learned

This project helped reinforce my knowledge of CSS Grid and how to create a responsive UI using a mobile-first approach. One of the key takeaways was effectively managing layout placement within a Bento grid structure.

#### Example Code:
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I plan to:
- Improve animation effects using Framer Motion.
- Explore dynamic theme switching for better accessibility.
- Optimize performance using Next.js best practices.

### Useful Resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Used for styling and layout enhancements.
